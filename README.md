# DungeonSchu
 a console-based adventure game where a hero explores a randomly generated map, faces challenges, and seeks an exit


## BST Rebalancing Justification

The current implementation does not include self-balancing (e.g., AVL or Red-Black tree). Instead, the BST is used as a simple binary search tree. While this may lead to unbalanced trees in some cases, the random distribution of challenges ensures that the tree remains reasonably balanced for the scope of this project.
